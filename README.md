Welcome to my GitHub repository for a RESTful API built with Express.js, EJS, and MySQL. This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, showcasing how to interact with a MySQL database using a Node.js backend. The project also utilizes EJS for templating, making it easy to render dynamic HTML pages.

Features
1.Create: Add new records to the MySQL database.
2.Read: Retrieve and display records from the database.
3.Update: Modify existing records in the database.
4.Delete: Remove records from the database.



Technologies Used
1.Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
2.Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
3.MySQL: A relational database management system.
4.EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
5.JavaScript: The programming language used for both the backend and frontend logic.
