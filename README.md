Welcome to my GitHub repository for a RESTful API built with Express.js, EJS, and MySQL. This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, showcasing how to interact with a MySQL database using a Node.js backend. The project also utilizes EJS for templating, making it easy to render dynamic HTML pages.

Features
Create: Add new records to the MySQL database.
Read: Retrieve and display records from the database.
Update: Modify existing records in the database.
Delete: Remove records from the database.
Technologies Used
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
MySQL: A relational database management system.
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
JavaScript: The programming language used for both the backend and frontend logic.
